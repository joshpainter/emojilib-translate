# emojilib-translate

emojilib-translate helps you translate normal text into emojis.

It uses the [muan/emojilib](https://github.com/muan/emojilib) as a datasource for emojis. Also included is an inverter script to invert this datasource for easier lookups.

This project was originally forked from [vbrown608/netlify-plugin-emoji-translate](https://github.com/vbrown608/netlify-plugin-emoji-translate) and the following high-level changes were made:

* Updated muan/emojilib dependency to 3.0.x
* Updated inverter.js to handle new muan/emojilib 3.x emoji datasource format
* Added additional logic to translator to handle emojis with multi-worded names
* Removed netlify-related plugin code to keep it simple
